# Snapchat-Memories-Enhanced-Downloader
Enhanced tool for downloading Snapchat memories with proper file naming, ZIP packaging, progress tracking, and month-by-month organization.

After Snapchat announced its subscription fees to store data over 5GB, a lot of people have been thinking of storing their memories somewhere else.
The memories can be exported and downloaded, but the functionalities are very limited: you can either download each memory one-by-one or download them all sequentially with weird names.
In my opinion, this is intentional in order to force users to choose to pay the subscription fee instead.

In collaboration with Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4), we made some adjustments to the original memories_history.html to enhance the dowloading experience and make it faster, organized, and more efficient.
